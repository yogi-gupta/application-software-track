## software-application-track
#### It's an IIT bombay bootcamp project. In this application, the client sends a message to the server, and the server should simply echo it back to the client. That is, the server must send the same message back to the client. The server should keep doing this as long as the client is connected to it.Server can listen to one or more client at the same time.
